README for Hmm
==============

Hmm is an implementation of a parser and proof verifier (and later maybe more)
for databases of mathematical proofs described using the Metamath language.
Metamath (see http://metamath.org) is both a file format for these databases,
specified in just a couple of pages (see the Metamath book); and an extensive
program to interactively view such databases, find proofs for statements, and
saving those proofs.  Metamath --in both meanings of the word-- was created and
is maintained by Norman Megill.  He also maintains an impressive Metamath
formalization of set theory, containing over 80000 lines with over 6000
theorems and lemmas proven from 17 axioms.

Hmm has been written as a cleanroom implementation of the Metamath
specification.

The longer-term goal is to use the Hmm module (which just parses and verifies a
database) as a basis for a program to generate calculational proofs from
Metamath proofs.

Hmm was written in Haskell by Marnix Klooster <marnix.klooster@gmail.com>.


Download
--------
At the time of writing, Hmm is found on the web at

	http://www.solcon.nl/mklooster/repos/hmm

This is actually a darcs repository, which means that the change history can be
downloaded, and patches can be submitted, using the darcs software
configuration management system (www.darcs.net).  Just install darcs and

	darcs get http://www.solcon.nl/mklooster/repos/hmm

This will create a directory 'hmm' with the latest version and the change
history.

To run Hmm you will need a Haskell implementation.  Hmm was developed using GHC
6.4 (see http://haskell.org/ghc/), but other Haskell implementations might work
as well.


Release notes
-------------
This is version 0.1, the first public release.  I have no idea whether I will
have time to hack further on Hmm in the future, but in any case bug reports,
patches (preferably using darcs), and comments are welcome.

Version 0.1 is intended to conform fully to the Metamath specification, with
the following exceptions:

 - Include files (i.e., $[ ... $]) are not supported.

 - Proofs containing unknown steps ('?') are not supported.

 - Optional disjoint variable restrictions for theorems (e.g., $d x y $. for a
   $p statement containing no y) are not necessary, even if they are used in
   the proof.
       This was done to make the implementation simpler.  It means that
   slightly more database files are accepted by Hmm than by Metamath.  However,
   Hmm allows exactly the same theorems to be proved as Metamath.


Acknowledgements
----------------
Thanks to Norman ``Norm'' Megill for the concept and implementation of
Metamath, and for set.mm as a gold mine of test data for Hmm.  And for being
very open and responsive to questions and remarks on Metamath.

Thanks to Haskell, the great programming language, and specifically to the
creators of GHC which I used to develop Hmm.  And also for that large and
growing collection of standard libraries that I'm happily using.

Thanks to Daan Leijen for Parsec, the beautiful parser library for Haskell.

Thanks to Dean Herington for creating HUnit, the Haskell Unit Test framework
that is used for the Hmm unit tests. 

And of course thanks to David Roundy for 'darcs', which enabled me develop
quickly on three different machines, and moving patches around very easily.
